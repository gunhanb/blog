In the previous post, we see that Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are conducted to show the efficacy of a drug. RCTs are very important cornerstone of *evidence-based medicine*. But, then a very natural question arises: What all other evidences say about the same topic, if any?


You may think that, of course any person who do research would know about literature review, right? One should review the literature to see what other people say about the topic. But in this case, we would need more systematic, more objective than just a literature review. This is called *systematic review*. 

The intuition of a systematic review is very nicely explained by the below quote from 1885 (Lord Rayleigh`s (a physics professor) presidential address for the British Association for the Advancement of Science):

> ...The work which deserves, but I am afraid does not always receive, the most
credit is that in which *discovery* and *explanation* go hand in hand, in which
not only are new facts presented, but their relation to old ones is pointed out.

Here, the *explanation* of the quote corresponds to systematic review. Basically, we need to specify the research question clearly (for example whether certain drug works for certain disease for certain target population), then we need to screen the papers (studies). Then, we may ended up zero study, right? In this case, we can, confidently, claim that more research is needed :) But normally, we end up some studies and then the task is statistically combine them. This last procedure or *meta-analysis* is the statistical component of a systematic review (which is the main interest of the post).
