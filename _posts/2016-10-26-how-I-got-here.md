As someone with zero experience writing blogpost etc., [Yihui Xie's minimal example](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-jekyll) and [this sample blog](http://statistics.rainandrhino.org/knitr-hyde/2015/12/12/sample-post.html) helped me a lot to start blogging. Normally, it can be quite tedious to work with a Jekyll-based blog for someone like me. However, Yihui's servr R package facilitate how to build a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) website which uses [knitr](yihui.name/knitr/) and Rmarkdown. By the way, I wanted to use Jekyll because I want to include R code to my blog posts. Also, I was lucky and I had experience with knitr and Rmarkdown before. Finally, with the help of Rstudio, the road for blogging with Jekyll is open for many more R users, I believe!
